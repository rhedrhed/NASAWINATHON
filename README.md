Your challenge is to develop an interactive visualization and simulation tool that enables users to explore asteroid impact scenarios, predict consequences, and evaluate mitigation strategies using real NASA and USGS datasets. Can you create a web-based platform that integrates asteroid parameter data (e.g., size, velocity, trajectory) from NASAâ€™s NEO API with USGS datasets pertaining to environmental and geological impacts (e.g., tsunami zones, seismic activity, topography), and transforms that raw data into a powerful educational and decision-support tool for global asteroid risk management?
